# SQL_Blocks

### 1 - You can assemble a simple object that will then be converted into an SQL command:

> a = Select('Actor') # --> SELECT * FROM Actor act

_Note that an alias "act" has been added._

You can specify your own alias:  `a = Select('Actor a')`

---
### 2 - You can also add a field, contains this...

* a = Select('Actor a', **name=Field**)

* Here are another ways to add a field:
    - Select('Actor a', name=Distinct )

    - Select('Actor a', name=NamedField('actors_name'))

    - Select(
        'Actor a', 
        name=NamedField('actors_name', Distinct)
    )


    2.1 -- Using expression as a field:
```
    Select(
        'Product',
        due_date=NamedField(
            'YEAR_ref',
            ExpressionField('extract(year from {f})') #  <<---
        )
    )
```
...should return: 
**SELECT extract(year from due_date) as YEAR_ref...**

---

### 3 - To set conditions, use **Where**:
* For example, `a = Select(... age=gt(45) )`

    Some possible conditions:
    * field=eq(value) - ...the field is EQUAL to the value;
    * field=gt(value) - ...the field is GREATER than the value;
    * field=lt(value) - ...the field is LESS than the value;

> You may use Where.**eq**, Where.**gt**, Where.**lt** ... or simply **eq**, **gt**, **lt** ... 😉

3.1 -- If you want to filter the field on a range of values:

`a = Select( 'Actor a', age=Between(45, 69) )`

3.2 -- Sub-queries:
```
query = Select('Movie m', title=Field,
    id=SelectIN(
        'Review r',
        rate=gt(4.5),
        movie_id=Distinct
    )
)
```

**>> print(query)** 

        SELECT
            m.title
        FROM
            Movie m
        WHERE
            m.id IN (
                SELECT DISTINCT r.movie
                FROM Review r WHERE r.rate > 4.5
            )
    
3.3 -- Optional conditions:
```
    OR=Options(
        genre=eq("Sci-Fi"),
        awards=contains("Oscar")
    )
    AND=Options(
        ..., name=contains(
            'Chris',
            Position.StartsWith
        )
    )
```

3.4 -- Negative conditions use the _Not_ class instead of _Where_
```
based_on_book=Not.is_null()
```

3.5 -- List of values
```
hash_tag=inside(['space', 'monster', 'gore'])
```

---
### 4 - A field can be two things at the same time:

* m = Select('Movie m' release_date=[Field, OrderBy])
    - This means that the field will appear in the results and also that the query will be ordered by that field.
* Applying **GROUP BY** to item 3.2, it would look contains this:
    ```    
    SelectIN(
        'Review r', movie=[GroupBy, Distinct],
        rate=Having.avg(gt(4.5))
    )
    ```
---
### 5 - Relationships:
```
    query = Select('Actor a', name=Field,
        cast=Select('Cast c', id=PrimaryKey)
    )
```
**>> print(query)**    
```
SELECT
    a.name
FROM
    Actor a
    JOIN Cast c ON (a.cast = c.id)    
```

---
### 6 - The reverse process (parse):
```
text = """
        SELECT
                cas.role,
                m.title,
                m.release_date,
                a.name as actors_name
        FROM
                Actor a
                LEFT JOIN Cast cas ON (a.cast = cas.id)
                LEFT JOIN Movie m ON (cas.movie = m.id)
        WHERE
                (
                    m.genre = 'Sci-Fi'
                    OR
                    m.awards LIKE '%Oscar%'
                )
                AND a.age <= 69 AND a.age >= 45
        ORDER BY
                m.release_date DESC
"""
```

`a, c, m = Select.parse(text)`

**6.1  --- print(a)**
```
    SELECT
            a.name as actors_name
    FROM
            Actor a
    WHERE
            a.age <= 69
            AND a.age >= 45
```

**6.2 --- print(c)**

    SELECT
            c.role
    FROM
            Cast c

**6.3 --- print(m)**

    SELECT
            m.title,
            m.release_date
    FROM
            Movie m
    WHERE
            ( m.genre = 'Sci-Fi' OR m.awards LIKE '%Oscar%' )
    ORDER BY
            m.release_date DESC



**6.4 --- print(a+c)**

    SELECT
            a.name as actors_name,
            cas.role
    FROM
            Actor a
            JOIN Cast cas ON (a.cast = cas.id)
    WHERE
            a.age >= 45
            AND a.age <= 69

**6.5 --- print(c+m)** 
> `... or  print(m+c)`

    SELECT
            cas.role,
            m.title,
            m.release_date,
            m.director
    FROM
            Cast cas
            JOIN Movie m ON (cas.movie = m.id)
    WHERE
            ( m.genre = 'Sci-Fi' OR m.awards LIKE '%Oscar%' )
            AND m.director LIKE '%Coppola%'
    ORDER BY
            m.release_date,
            m.director
---

### 7 - You can add or delete attributes directly in objects:
* a(gender=Field)
* m.delete('director')

---

### 8 - Defining relationship on separate objects:
```
a = Select...
c = Select...
m = Select...
```
`a + c => ERROR: "No relationship found between Actor and Cast"`

8.1 - But...

    a( cast=ForeignKey('Cast') )
    c(id=PrimaryKey)

**a + c => Ok!**

8.2

    c( movie=ForeignKey('Movie') )
    m(id=PrimaryKey)

> **c + m => Ok!**
>> **m + c => Ok!**


---

### 9 - Comparing objects

9.1
```
        a1 = Select.parse('''
                SELECT gender, Max(act.age) FROM Actor act
                WHERE act.age <= 69 AND act.age >= 45
                GROUP BY gender
            ''')[0]

        a2 = Select('Actor',
            age=[ Between(45, 69), Max ],
            gender=[GroupBy, Field]
        )       
```
> **a1 == a2 # --- True!**



9.2
```
    m1 = Select.parse("""
        SELECT title, release_date FROM Movie m ORDER BY release_date 
        WHERE m.genre = 'Sci-Fi' AND m.awards LIKE '%Oscar%'
    """)[0]

    m2 = Select.parse("""
        SELECT release_date, title
        FROM Movie m
        WHERE m.awards LIKE '%Oscar%' AND m.genre = 'Sci-Fi'
        ORDER BY release_date 
    """)[0]
```

**m1 == m2  #  --- True!**


9.3
```
best_movies = SelectIN(
    Review=Table('role'),
    rate=[GroupBy, Having.avg(gt(4.5))]
)
m1 = Select(
    Movie=Table('title,release_date'),
    id=best_movies
)

sql = "SELECT rev.role FROM Review rev GROUP BY rev.rate HAVING Avg(rev.rate) > 4.5"
m2 = Select(
    'Movie', release_date=Field, title=Field,
    id=Where(f"IN ({sql})")
)
```
**m1 == m2 # --- True!**

---

### 10 - CASE...WHEN...THEN
    Select(
        'Product',
        label=Case('price').when(
            lt(50), 'cheap'
        ).when(
            gt(100), 'expensive'
        ).else_value(
            'normal'
        )
    )

---

### 11 - optimize method
    p1 = Select.parse("""
            SELECT * FROM Product p
            WHERE (p.category = 'Gizmo'
                    OR p.category = 'Gadget'
                    OR p.category = 'Doohickey')
                AND NOT price <= 387.64
                AND YEAR(last_sale) = 2024
            ORDER BY
                category
        """)[0]
        p1.optimize() #  <<===============
        p2 = Select.parse("""
            SELECT category FROM Product p
            WHERE category IN ('Gizmo','Gadget','Doohickey')
                and p.price > 387.64
                and p.last_sale >= '2024-01-01'
                and p.last_sale <= '2024-12-31'
            ORDER BY p.category LIMIT 100
        """)[0]
        p1 == p2 # --- True!

 This will...
* Replace `OR` conditions to `SELECT IN ...`
* Put `LIMIT` if no fields or conditions defined;
* Normalizes inverted conditions;
* Auto includes fields present in `ORDER/GROUP BY`;
* Replace `YEAR` function with date range comparison.

> The method allows you to select which rules you want to apply in the optimization...Or define your own rules!

>> NOTE: When a joined table is used only as a filter, it is possible that it can be changed to a sub-query:

    query = Select(
        'Installments i', due_date=Field,  customer=Select(
            'Customer c', id=PrimaryKey,
            name=contains('Smith', Position.EndsWith)
        )
    )
    print(query)
    print('-----')
    query.optimize([RuleReplaceJoinBySubselect])
    print(query)
```
SELECT
        i.due_date
FROM
        Installments i
        JOIN Customer c ON (i.customer = c.id)
WHERE
        c.name LIKE '%Smith'
-----
SELECT
        i.due_date
FROM
        Installments i
WHERE
        i.customer IN (SELECT c.id FROM Customer c WHERE c.name LIKE '%Smith')
```

---

### 12 - Adding multiple fields at once
```
    query = Select('post p')
    query.add_fields(
        'user_id, created_at',
        order_by=True, group_by=True
    )
```
...is the same as...
```
    query = Select(
        'post p',
        user_id=[Field, GroupBy, OrderBy],
        created_at=[Field, GroupBy, OrderBy]
    )
```

### 13 - Change parser engine
```
a, c, m = Select.parse(
    """
        Actor(name, id ?age = 40)
        <- Cast(actor_id, movie_id) ->
        Movie(id ^title)
    """,
    CypherParser
    # ^^^ recognizes syntax like Neo4J queries
)
```

**print(a+c+m)**
```
SELECT
        act.name,
        mov.title
FROM
        Cast cas
        JOIN Movie mov ON (cas.movie_id = mov.id)
        JOIN Actor act ON (cas.actor_id = act.id)
WHERE
        act.age = 40
ORDER BY
        mov.title
```
---
> **Separators and meaning:**
* `(  )`  Delimits a table and its fields
* `,` Separate fields
* `?` For simple conditions (> < = <>)
* `<-` connects to the table on the left
* `->` connects to the table on the right
* `^` Put the field in the ORDER BY clause
* `@` Immediately after the table name, it indicates the grouping field.
* `$` For SQL functions like **avg**$_field_, **sum**$_field_, **count**$_field_...

## `detect` function

It is useful to write a query in a few lines, without specifying the script type (cypher, mongoDB, SQL, Neo4J...)
### Examples:

> **13.1 - Relationship**
```
query = detect(
    'MATCH(c:Customer)<-[:Order]->(p:Product)RETURN c, p'
)
print(query)
```
##### output:
    SELECT * FROM
        Order ord
        LEFT JOIN Customer cus ON (ord.customer_id = cus.id)
        RIGHT JOIN Product pro ON (ord.product_id = pro.id)
> **13.2 - Grouping**
```
query = detect(
    'People@gender(avg$age?region="SOUTH"^count$qtde)'
)
print(query)
```
##### output:
    SELECT
            peo.gender,
            Avg(peo.age),
            Count(*) as qtde
    FROM
            People peo
    WHERE
            peo.region = "SOUTH"
    GROUP BY
            peo.gender
    ORDER BY
            peo.qtde

> **13.3 - Many conditions...**
```
    print( detect('''
        db.people.find({
            {
                $or: [
                    {status:{$eq:"B"}},
                    age:{$lt:50}
                ]
            },
            age:{$gte:18},  status:{$eq:"A"}
        },{
            name: 1, user_id: 1
        }).sort({
            user_id: -1
        })
    ''') )
```
#### output:
    SELECT
            peo.name,
            peo.user_id
    FROM
            people peo
    WHERE
            ( peo. = 'B' OR peo.age < 50 ) AND
            peo.age >= 18 AND
            peo.status = 'A'
    ORDER BY
            peo.user_id DESC

> **13.4 - Relations with same table twice (or more)**

Automatically assigns aliases to each side of the relationship (In this example, one user invites another to add to their contact list)
```
    print( detect(
        'User(^name,id) <-Contact(requester,guest)-> User(id,name)'
       # ^^^ u1                                        ^^^ u2
    ) )
```
    SELECT
            u1.name,
            u2.name
    FROM
            Contact con
            RIGHT JOIN User u2 ON (con.guest = u2.id)
            LEFT JOIN User u1 ON (con.requester = u1.id)
    ORDER BY
            u1.name

---
### `translate_to` method
It consists of the inverse process of parsing: From a Select object, it returns the text to a script in any of the languages ​​below:
* QueryLanguage - default
* MongoDBLanguage
* Neo4JLanguage

---
### 14 - Window Function

Aggregation functions (Avg, Min, Max, Sum, Count) -- or Window functions (Lead, Lag, Row_Number, Rank) -- have the **over** method...

    query=Select(
        'Enrollment e',
        payment=Sum().over(
            student_id=Partition, due_date=OrderBy,
            # _=Rows(Current(), Following(5)), 
               # ^^^-------> ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND 5 FOLLOWING
            # _=Rows(Preceding(3), Following()),
               # ^^^-------> ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
            # _=Rows(Preceding(3)) 
               # ^^^-------> ROWS 3 PRECEDING
        ).As('sum_per_student')
    )

...that generates the following query:

```
SELECT
        Sum(e.payment) OVER(
                PARTITION BY student_id
                ORDER BY due_date
        ) as sum_per_student
FROM
        Enrollment e
```
---
### 15 - The `As` method:
    query=Select(
        'Customers c',
        phone=[
            Not.is_null(),
            SubString(1, 4).As('area_code', GroupBy)
        ],
        customer_id=[
            Count().As('customer_count', OrderBy),
            Having.count(gt(5))
        ]
    )
You can use the result of a function as a new field -- and optionally use it in ORDER BY and/or GROUP BY clause(s):
```
SELECT
        SubString(c.phone, 1, 4) as area_code,
        Count(c.customer_id) as customer_count
FROM
        Customers c
WHERE
        NOT c.phone IS NULL
GROUP BY
        area_code HAVING Count(c.customer_id) > 5
ORDER BY
        customer_count
```
---
### 16 - Function classes
You may use this functions:
* SubString
* Round
* DateDiff
* Year
* Current_Date
* Avg
* Min
* Max
* Sum
* Count
* Lag
* Lead
* Row_Number
* Rank
* Coalesce
* Cast
> Some of these functions may vary in syntax depending on the database.
For example, if your query is going to run on Oracle, do the following:

`Function.dialect = Dialect.ORACLE`
